## Notes

- We didn't have time to give Lonely Moon an actual win state, so just fly around and explore!
- Your moon is affected by gravity, but you still have control over where it goes. Use gravity to your advantage to slingshot around!
- Keep falling into the sun or crashing into planets? Try adding velocity by moving in the direction you're already flying.

## Bugs

- Sometimes the player can get stuck inside of one of the planets. If you get stuck just press "R" to reset to your starting point.
